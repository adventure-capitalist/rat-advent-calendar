This is a rat advent calendar which renders windows behind which are photos of festive rats. 

The conditions are based off the Date object, in that it must be December for the calendar's conditional rendering of each window to engage at all, AND users are not allowed to peek ahead. The current Date in December must have already occured. 

The rats are very cute and joyous.
